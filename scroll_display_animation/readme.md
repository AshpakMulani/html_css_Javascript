I know...I know.... there is already AOS library for this but, this code repo explores different ways including AOS library to animate objects on screen during scrolling.


## getBoundingClientRect element method
ref : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect

function returns DomRect object about size and position. This object can be scanned to get current position of object and check if it has reached viewport. Custom calculations needs to be performed to udnerstand objects locaiton compared to viewport.

First 6 objects on page are animated with this type of implimentation
